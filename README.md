# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. The project utilizes libraries such as numpy and pandas for data manipulation and cleaning, and matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization. The aim is to preprocess the data, perform detailed analysis, and visualize key insights.

## Problem Statement

The main objective of this project is to clean and analyze a given dataset to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and insights. This process involves:

- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Correcting inconsistent data
- Analyzing the distribution of data
- Visualizing relationships between variables
- Identifying trends and outliers

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can vary depending on the specific analysis. It typically includes multiple features that require cleaning and exploration. The dataset might include columns such as:

- `Feature1`
- `Feature2`
- `Feature3`
- ...
- `FeatureN`

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Handle missing values
   - Remove duplicates
   - Correct inconsistent data entries
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
   - Identifying patterns and trends
   - Analyzing correlations between variables

## Libraries Used

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
